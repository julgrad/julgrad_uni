# Data Analysis
 R project focusing on statistical data analysis techniques using several complex R libraries and functions to derive insights from various datasets.
Libraries Used
'dplyr': For data manipulation.
ggplot2: For data visualization.
margins: For calculating marginal effects in regression models.
estimatr: For robust statistical estimations.
Key Techniques
Regression Analysis: Logistic regression, Linear Regression Discontinuity.
Data Transformation: Creating subsets, transforming variables.
Statistical Testing: Shapiro-Wilk test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
Visualization: Scatter plots, bar plots, and boxplots.
Highlights
Logistic Regression with glm(): Used for modeling binary outcome variables in admissions data.
Linear Regression Discontinuity Analysis: Employed to assess the impact of the legal drinking age on alcohol-related deaths.
Robust Estimation with lm_robust(): Applied to study the effects of concealed weapons laws on violent crime rates.
